The overriding design goal for Markdown's
formatting syntax is to make it as readable
as possible. The idea is that a
Markdown-formatted document should be
publishable as-is, as plain text, without
looking like it's been marked up with tags
or formatting instructions.


$$
% \f is defined as #1f(#2) using the macro
\f\relax{x} = \int_{-\infty}^\infty
    \f\hat\xi\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}
    \,d\xi
$$

```sh
$ cd dillinger
$ npm install -d
$ node app
```
And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```
