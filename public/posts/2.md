# The scheme programming language

- No changes made to this post 

This is the parent post and mostly intended to be a starting
point to this lineage, as there is progress in this topic I will
be posting subsequent posts that are meant to follow this.

Some things that are surely to be posted are
- Implementing some common programs in scheme
- scheme's functional approach and what it means
- OO and functional equivalence
- etc... as life goes on
