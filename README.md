# A simple blog manager for github
Yet another github blog design.

The blog is supposed to be completely seperate from the content, allows for a 
data independent UI. Data may be stored elsewhere in a seperate repo, making 
the blog design just a way to organize your posts. 


[demo](https://meetesh06.github.io/Blog)

### Feel Free to reuse for your own blogs

- improve state management (avoid duplication) -> REDUX managed
- refactor code -> never complete innit
- add no cache policy -> forced approach applied, try testing if headers are supported by the server 

## TODO
- show index for posts 
- make posts schema.org valid 
- add reading time
- implement inbuilt dictionary
- ..etc
